## Objective

To enhance operational efficiency and streamline workflow processes, enabling our team to dedicate more time to revenue-generating activities & innovative projects.

## Current Problem Statement

Every week, our data team compiles a report for sales leadership that details leads from the week, deals closed, forecasted sales for the remainder of the year, etc. This process, utilizing a combination of Excel, BI Tools, and PowerPoint, requires approximately `r params$hoursPerWeek` hours per week from `r params$peopleNum` individuals across the organization, with an estimated people-cost of ~`r scales::dollar(params$peopleCost)`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
vbs <- list(
  value_box(
    title = "People required",
    value = params$peopleNum,
    showcase = bs_icon("people-fill"),
    theme = "background-color: #F0E9E0!important;"
  ),
  value_box(
    title = "Hours per week",
    value = params$hoursPerWeek,
    showcase = bs_icon("clock-fill"),
    theme = "background-color: #F0E9E0!important;"
  ),
  value_box(
    title = "Estimated people-cost",
    value = scales::dollar(params$peopleCost),
    showcase = bs_icon("piggy-bank-fill"),
    theme = "background-color: #FFC0CB!important;"
  )
)

layout_column_wrap(
  width = "250px",
  !!!vbs
)
```

The existing tools lack essential features necessary for an automated code-based approach, resulting in increased time spent on manual processes and a higher risk of errors. Moreover, the existing process depends on the availability of specific individuals in the office or working during PTO to deliver the refreshed report on time. This dependency introduces operational limitations and underscores the need for a more efficient and reliable reporting solution.
